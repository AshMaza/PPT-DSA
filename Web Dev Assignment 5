Answer 1:-
Synchronous and asynchronous are two different ways of executing code in a program.

Synchronous code is executed sequentially, where each operation waits for the previous one to complete before moving on to the next. This means that the program will be blocked until a particular operation is finished, and no other code can run in the meantime. Synchronous operations are easier to understand and debug, but they can result in slower program execution if there are time-consuming tasks.

On the other hand, asynchronous code allows multiple operations to be executed concurrently. It allows the program to continue running while waiting for a particular operation to complete. Asynchronous operations are commonly used for tasks like network requests or file operations, where waiting for the operation to finish would otherwise block the program. Asynchronous programming can enhance the performance and responsiveness of an application.

Answer 2:-
Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other over the internet. Web APIs provide a standardized way for developers to access and manipulate data or services provided by other applications or platforms.

Web APIs are commonly used to retrieve data from remote servers using HTTP requests. They enable developers to integrate third-party services, access databases, retrieve weather information, perform user authentication, and much more. Popular web APIs include the Google Maps API, Twitter API, and GitHub API.

Developers can access web APIs by making HTTP requests (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specific URLs and receive responses in different formats like JSON or XML. APIs enable developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications by leveraging the functionalities provided by other applications or services.

Answer 3:-
setTimeout` and `setInterval` are functions in JavaScript used for scheduling code execution after a specified time interval.

The `setTimeout` function is used to delay the execution of a function by a specified number of milliseconds. It takes two parameters: a function to be executed and the delay time in milliseconds. After the specified delay, the function is invoked.

Example:
```javascript
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Delayed message");
}, 2000); // Executes after 2 seconds
```

The `setInterval` function is similar to `setTimeout`, but it repeatedly executes a function at a specified interval. It also takes a function to be executed and the delay time in milliseconds. The function continues to execute until it is explicitly cleared using the `clearInterval` function.

Example:
```javascript
setInterval(function() {
  console.log("Repeated message");
}, 1000); // Executes every 1 second
```

Answer 4:-
In JavaScript, there are several ways to handle asynchronous code:

1. Callbacks: Callback functions are passed as arguments to asynchronous functions. They are executed once the asynchronous operation is complete. Callbacks can lead to callback hell when there are multiple nested callbacks, making the code difficult to read and maintain.

2. Promises: Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations. A promise represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. Promises allow chaining and provide methods like `then()` and `catch()` to handle the success and error cases respectively.

3. Async/await: Async/await is a modern approach to handling asynchronous code. It is built on top of promises and provides a more readable and synchronous-like syntax. The `async` keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function, and the `await` keyword is used to pause the execution until a promise is fulfilled or rejected. It simplifies error handling and avoids the callback hell problem.

Answer 5:-
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are executed when a certain task is completed. In JavaScript, callbacks are commonly used to handle asynchronous operations. However, when callbacks are nested inside each other, it can lead to a situation called "Callback Hell" or "Pyramid of Doom."

Callback Hell occurs when there are multiple nested callbacks, making the code difficult to read, understand, and maintain. It can result in deeply indented code, known as the pyramid shape, which reduces code clarity and makes it prone to errors.

Here's an example of Callback Hell:
```javascript
asyncFunc1(function() {
  asyncFunc2(function() {
    asyncFunc3(function() {
      // More nested callbacks...
    });
  });
});
```

To mitigate the issues caused by callback hell, other approaches like promises or async/await can be used to write more readable and maintainable asynchronous code.

Answer 6:-
Promises are objects in JavaScript that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. They simplify the handling of asynchronous code and provide a cleaner alternative to callbacks.

Promises have three states:
1. Pending: The initial state, representing an ongoing asynchronous operation.
2. Fulfilled: The state when the asynchronous operation is successful, resulting in a resolved promise with a value.
3. Rejected: The state when the asynchronous operation encounters an error, resulting in a rejected promise with a reason for failure.

Three important methods of promises are:
1. `then()`: It is used to handle the fulfillment of a promise and takes two optional callbacks: `onFulfilled` for handling success and `onRejected` for handling failure.
2. `catch()`: It is used to handle the rejection of a promise. It is similar to `then()` with only an `onRejected` callback and is used for error handling.
3. `finally()`: It is used to specify a callback to be executed regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected. It allows you to perform cleanup or finalization tasks.

Example:
```javascript
fetchData()
  .then(function(result) {
    console.log("Success: ", result);
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.log("Error: ", error);
  })
  .finally(function() {
    console.log("Cleanup");
  });
```

Answer 7:-
`async` and `await` are keywords introduced in JavaScript to handle asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like manner. They are built on top of promises and provide a cleaner and more readable syntax.

The `async` keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function. It allows the function to use the `await` keyword inside it. When a function is declared as `async`, it always returns a promise.

The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of an asynchronous function until a promise is fulfilled or rejected. It can only be used inside an `async` function. When `await` is used with a promise, it waits for the promise to resolve and returns the resolved value. If the promise is rejected, it throws an error that can be caught using `try...catch`.

Example:
```javascript
async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Error:', error);
  }
}
```

The `await` keyword simplifies the syntax for handling promises, making the code appear more sequential and easier to understand.

Answer 8:-
The `try` and `catch` blocks are used in JavaScript for error handling. They are part of the `try...catch` statement.

The purpose of the `try` block is to enclose the code that might throw an error

. If an error occurs within the `try` block, the execution is immediately transferred to the `catch` block.

The `catch` block is used to handle the error that occurred within the `try` block. It specifies the code that should be executed when an exception is caught. The caught error is passed as an argument to the `catch` block, allowing you to access the error information and perform appropriate actions, such as logging an error message or recovering from the error.

The `try...catch` statement is essential for proper error handling in JavaScript. It prevents the program from crashing when unexpected errors occur and allows developers to gracefully handle exceptions.

Answer 9:-
`fetch` is a built-in function in JavaScript used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to servers and retrieve resources. It is commonly used to fetch data from APIs.

The `fetch` function returns a promise that resolves to the `Response` object representing the response to the request. The `Response` object provides several methods to handle the response, such as `json()` to extract JSON data, `text()` to get the response as text, and `blob()` to get the response as a binary object.

Example:
```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(function(response) {
    if (response.ok) {
      return response.json();
    } else {
      throw new Error('Error: ' + response.status);
    }
  })
  .then(function(data) {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.log('Error:', error);
  });
```

The `fetch` function provides a simple and powerful way to handle HTTP requests and retrieve data from remote servers, enabling the development of dynamic and interactive web applications.

Answer 10:-
Defining an asynchronous function in JavaScript using `async/await`, you use the `async` keyword before the function declaration. This indicates that the function will contain asynchronous operations. Within the function body, you can use the `await` keyword before promises to pause the execution and wait for their resolution. This allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like manner, making it easier to read and understand.
