Answer 1:-
A constructor is a special method in a class that is used to initialize objects of that class. It is called automatically when an object is created. The purpose of a constructor is to set the initial state of an object, assign values to its properties, and perform any necessary setup. Constructors are essential for creating and initializing objects in object-oriented programming.

Answer 2:-
The "this" keyword in JavaScript refers to the current object instance within a class or method. Its purpose is to access and manipulate the properties and methods of the current object. It allows distinguishing between local variables and instance variables with the same name. "this" is used to refer to the current object context, enabling object-oriented programming principles to be implemented.

Answer 3:-
The call, apply, and bind methods are used to manipulate the context of a function in JavaScript. They allow controlling what the "this" keyword refers to within a function.

- The "call" method invokes a function with a specified "this" value and optional arguments passed individually.
- The "apply" method is similar to "call" but takes arguments as an array.
- The "bind" method creates a new function with a specified "this" value and optional arguments. It does not immediately invoke the function.

Answer 4:-
OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It focuses on encapsulating data and behavior together into reusable and modular units. OOPS provides concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to structure and design code for better organization, reusability, and maintainability.

Answer5:-
Abstraction is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming. It involves hiding the internal details and complexities of an object and providing a simplified interface for interacting with it. The purpose of abstraction is to reduce complexity, improve code maintainability, and provide a high-level view of functionality. It allows users to interact with objects using only essential methods and properties, without needing to understand the underlying implementation.

Answer6:-
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on different forms or have multiple behaviors. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The purpose of polymorphism is to create code that can work with objects of different types, providing flexibility and extensibility. It enables code reuse and supports the principle of "write once, use anywhere."

Answer 7:-
Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It enables code reuse, extensibility, and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. The purpose of inheritance is to promote code reusability by allowing a subclass to inherit and extend the functionality of a superclass. It helps in organizing and structuring code by establishing an "is-a" relationship between classes.

Answer 8:-
Encapsulation is a principle in object-oriented programming that involves bundling data and methods together within a class and controlling access to them through public and private interfaces. The purpose of encapsulation is to protect the internal state of an object from being directly accessed or modified by external code. It promotes data integrity, code maintainability, and allows for better control over how objects are used and interacted with.

Answer 9:
In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that objects of the class will have. The class acts as a template or a constructor for creating multiple instances (objects) with the same structure and behavior. It allows for the implementation of object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Answer 10: 
The "super" keyword in JavaScript is used to call and access the parent class's constructor, properties, and methods from within a subclass. It is often used when extending a class to initialize the inherited properties and override methods while maintaining the parent class's functionality. The "super" keyword is essential for achieving inheritance and ensuring proper initialization and behavior of subclass instances.
